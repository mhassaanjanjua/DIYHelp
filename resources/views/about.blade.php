									<p> Availability of skilled workforce is one of the major challenge for normal household. It is not only expensive but the lead time to get services from the skilled individual is very high and a normal household often need to wait for weeks and even months to get a normal repair job.
										Sometimes, a person might have the skills to carry on the tasks but don't have equipment to get the things done.</p>

									<p> In this sharing economy, when people are sharing their homes (airbnb), cars (uber), bikes (bikya), offices (wework), my idea revolves around the concept of skills and tools sharing.
									</p>
									<p>
										The idea is to offer a platform which would connect a household with a skilled individual. People can share their skills as a freelancer and might also share their equipment with others. The idea is based on the concept of Fab Labs or Maker Spaces where individuals share tools and equipment to fulfill their needs.
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, if my wardrobe get broken and I can repair it myself but i do not have requisite tools. How expensive would it for me to buy tools to make a small repair. How nice would it be if I can rent them out for repairing from this platform. In anyway, If i don't have the expertise to do it myself then, I can even hire a professional carpenter in his or her free time as an independent freelancer to get the things done. </p>
